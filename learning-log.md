## Day 1 – Git Setup and Repository Structure

Today I configured Git and connected my local machine to GitHub using the command line.

### What I Learned

- Cloning a remote repository using `git clone`
- Navigating through directories with `cd`
- Checking repository status using `git status`
- Creating folders using `mkdir`
- Understanding that Git does not track empty folders
- Using `.gitkeep` files to preserve structure
- Staging files with `git add`
- Creating commits with `git commit`
- Synchronizing changes using `git push`

### Key Understanding

Each commit represents a version of the project. Clear and professional commit messages are essential because they document the evolution of the system.

This marks the beginning of my structured backend development journey.
